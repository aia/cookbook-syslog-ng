Description
===========

The Syslog NG cookbook installs and configures syslog-ng service. There are two recipes

* syslog-ng enables syslog-ng but does not affect your current syslog configuration
* syslog-ng::global disables your existing syslog and configures syslog-ng to handle system logging

There are also four definitions

* syslog_ng_source configures syslog-ng to listen on a udp port
* syslog_ng_filter configures a filter
* syslog_ng_file configures syslog-ng to write logs it receives to a file
* syslog_ng_forwarder configures syslog-ng to forward logs it receives to another syslog server

The path to logfiles is generated by concatenating log_base, the application name, and log_name. When setting log_base and log_name you can use syslog-ng macros. For example, log_name could be "${YEAR}/${MONTH}/${DAY}/${HOUR}.log"

The cookbook has been written for and tested on CentOS with syslog-ng 2.1.4.
Syslog NG can be obtained [here: balabit.com](http://www.balabit.com/downloads/files?path=/syslog-ng/sources/2.1.4). 

Requirements
============

* Chef 0.8+
* Syslog-NG 2.x package
